In order to actually get information about vehicles that might match our description,
we need to get multiple lines AROUND each match.  We can use the -A, -B, or -C option with grep:

	grep -A 5 "L337" mystery/vehicles

This will match the license plates that contain "L337" and, for each match, show us the five lines AFTER it.
